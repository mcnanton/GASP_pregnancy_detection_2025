## Background

Use of structured data to estimate pregnancy outcomes:

![](imagenes/maddie.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Capture of the journal article titled 'Development and evaluation of MADDIE: Method to Acquire Delivery Date Information from Electronic Health Records,' published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics, Volume 145, January 2021. Authors listed are Silvia P. Canelón, Heather H. Burris, Lisa D. Levine, and Mary Regina Boland."}

[**Aim**]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}: Develop an algorithm that infers patient delivery dates (PDDs) and delivery-specific details from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with high accuracy, enabling pregnancy-level outcome studies in women's health.

## Tools

### R-based, open-source ecosystem for scalable health data processing

![](imagenes/herramientas.png){fig-align="center" width="659" fig-alt="Image with the logos of the tools Gitlab, tidyverse, dplyr, dbplyr, tidyr, lubridate, stringr, janitor and agiseR. Above them, a screen capture of the structure of some of GOGIES' DataWarehouse tables, and a diagram of SIGEHOS database infrastructure being ingested in the DataWarehouse"}

::: {.callout-note}
### `agiseR`

is an internal R package developed by our team to facilitate access to local databases and automate reporting workflows.

### Records and pregnancies

### Extraction of Gestational Age (GA) values

![](imagenes/1_extraction.png){fig-align="center" width="669" fig-alt="Diagram showing a patient's timeline. Black-outlined circles represent electronic health records from which a value of Gestational Age could be extraced, while grey circles indicate no GA was obtained"}

### Clustering of records
![](imagenes/2_grouping.png){fig-align="center" width="669" fig-alt="Diagram showing a patient's timeline. Grey outlined circles represent non-informative records. Coloured circles represent records refering to different pregnancies according to their colour"}

Our algorithm identifies which records have pregnancy data, and which pregnancy they correspond to.</span>

### Delimiting of detected pregnancy

### Updating

![](imagenes/diag_general.png){fig-align="center" width="669" fig-alt="Flowchart illustrating how a new medical record is classified in relation to pregnancy detection. It begins with a new record and asks whether it matches someone with a detected pregnancy. If not, it's marked as a new pregnancy. If yes, it checks if the pregnancy is already known. If not, it's also a new pregnancy. If yes, and based on comparing changes in gestational age versus record date, the record is classified as new information about an ongoing pregnancy, indicating either end of pregnancy or higher gestational age."}

## Project's impact
### Available pregnancy patient information and efficient processing for secondary uses of health data.
#### Primary healthcare{.tight-list}
- **Alert rules** for specific conditions
- **Result indicators** for appropriate checkups
- **Managing** conditions alongside a pregnancy

#### Healthcare cost recovery{.tight-list}
- Generation of **tracer indicators**

#### Mandatory reportable diseases{.tight-list}
- **Differentiate** pregnant patients for Epidemiological Bulletin
